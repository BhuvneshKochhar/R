# 📊 Data Analysis with R

Welcome to my Data Analysis with R repository! 

🪐 This space showcases various regression analysis projects I've worked on using R. 

You will find:

• 📑 **Reports (PDFs and HTML)**: Comprehensive reports generated from the regression analyses using R-Markdown.
• 📊 **Datasets (usually .csv)**: The datasets used in the analysis, sourced from both built-in R datasets and Kaggle. If a dataset is too large to upload, I’ll include a link to it.

## How to Use

After navigating to the appropriate folder:

1. 📖 View the PDF files for a well-formatted report of the regression analyses.
2. 🌐 If the dataset is linked externally, download it from the provided Kaggle link.

## 🚀 Datasets

Datasets are sourced from Kaggle and other open data platforms, as well as built-in R datasets. If you’d like to explore them further, I’ve included the relevant links where necessary.

Thank you for visiting the Data Analysis with R repository! Happy analysing! 🎉
